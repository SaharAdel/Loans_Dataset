# **What is the structure of your dataset?** <br>
# The dataset contains 113,937 loans since 2005/2014 with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, current loan status, borrower income, borrower occupation, and many others. <br>
# It's contains qualititave varibles such as loan status, loan category, borrower state and occupation and others. Also, it's contains quantitave variables such as loan amount, term, borrower income and others.
# 
# **What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?** <br>
# I'm interesting to investigate what factors affect a loanâ€™s outcome status.
# 
# **What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?** <br>
# I'll investigating about difference columns (borrower income, occupation, state, etc.) and then exploaring if they affect of the loan's status, if they, i'll sorted them odrinally.

# ## Univariate Exploration

# The section contains univariate exploration of the dataset columns. Let's start with some qualitative variables followed by some quantitative variables .

# In[20]:


# display loan status
base_color = sb.color_palette()[0]
st_order = df_loan['LoanStatus'].value_counts().index
sb.countplot(data = df_loan, y = 'LoanStatus', color = base_color, order = st_order);


# In[21]:


# sort loan category listing
cat_order = df_loan['ListingCategory'].value_counts().index
sb.countplot(data = df_loan, x = 'ListingCategory', color = base_color, order = cat_order);
# change the figure size
sb.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(15,10)});


# > The category of the listing that the borrower selected when posting their listing:<br> 0 - Not Available, 1 - Debt Consolidation, 2 - Home Improvement, 3 - Business, 4 - Personal Loan, 5 - Student Use, 6 - Auto, 7- Other, 8 - Baby&Adoption, 9 - Boat, 10 - Cosmetic Procedure, 11 - Engagement Ring, 12 - Green Loans, 13 - Household Expenses, 14 - Large Purchases, 15 - Medical/Dental, 16 - Motorcycle, 17 - RV, 18 - Taxes, 19 - Vacation, 20 - Wedding Loans

# In[22]:


# display the percentage of borrower state
n_state = df_loan['BorrowerState'].value_counts().sum()
state_order = df_loan['BorrowerState'].value_counts().index
sb.countplot(data=df_loan, x='BorrowerState', color=base_color, order=state_order);

max_state = df_loan['BorrowerState'].value_counts()

# get the current tick locations and labels
locs, labels = plt.xticks(rotation=90) 

# loop through each pair of locations and labels
for loc, label in zip(locs, labels):

    # get the text property for the label to get the correct count
    count = max_state[label.get_text()]
    pct_string = '{:d}%'.format(int(100*count/n_state))

    # print the annotation just below the top of the bar
    plt.text(loc, count+2, pct_string, ha = 'center', color = 'black')

# change the figure size
sb.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(15,10)});


# In[23]:


# display top borrower occupation
oc_order = df_loan['Occupation'].value_counts().nlargest(15).index
sb.countplot(data = df_loan, y = 'Occupation', color = base_color, order = oc_order);


# In[24]:


# is the borrower own a home?
df_loan.IsBorrowerHomeowner.value_counts().plot(kind = 'pie', autopct= '%1.1f%%');


# In[25]:


# display loans amount
plt.hist(data = df_loan, x = 'LoanOriginalAmount', bins = 30);


# > non-uniform distribution/ right skewed of data points in different bins??

# In[26]:


df_loan.LoanOriginalAmount.describe()


# **Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?** <br>
# The loan amount variable divided defualted into only ten bins that is too few to understand the distribution of the data, so I divided it to 20, 30 bins, respecivelly, to understand the ditribution. In both, the figure is right skewed distribution (positive).
# 
# **Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?** <br>
# After investigating the dataset and selecting the interset columns, there are some columns depending on previous loans for a borrower which is contains a huge of nan, regarding to not all borrowers have previous loans. So, for tidiness, I breaking these columns with the key id to a new dataset for borrower they have previous loan.

# <a id='bi'></a>
# ## Bivariate Exploration

# The section contains bivariate exploration of dataset to look the relationship and correlation between two variables. There are showing two cases, quantitative vs. quantitative variables useing scatter plot for exploring the relation between loan amount and borrower income. Additionally, quantitative vs. qualitative variables using violin plot for exploring the relation between borrower they are losing thier occupation before completing loan payments and loan status.

# In[27]:


# relation between loan amount and borrower income
plt.scatter(data = df_loan, x = 'LoanOriginalAmount', y = 'StatedMonthlyIncome')
plt.title('Relation Between Loan Amount and Borrower Income')
plt.xlabel('Loan Amount')
plt.ylabel('Monthly Income');


# > The visualization showing overplotting where the high amount of overlap in points makes it difficult to see the actual relationship between the plotted variables.

# In[28]:


# scale? 
sb.regplot(data = df_loan, x = 'LoanOriginalAmount', y = 'StatedMonthlyIncome', truncate=False, x_jitter=0.3)
plt.ylim(0, 0.7)
plt.title('Relation Between Loan Amount and Borrower Income')
plt.xlabel('Loan Amount')
plt.ylabel('Monthly Income (1e5)');


# > After employ transparency and jitter for previous chart to make the scatter plot more informative. Used jitter to move the position of each point slightly from its true value.

# In[29]:


df_loan.corr()


# > Regarding to the correlation coefficient between loan amount and monthly income which is equal to 0.2, there is positive and weak relationship.

# In[30]:


# number of borrowers they have loan duration is more than their employment duration
len(df_loan[df_loan.Term > df_loan.EmploymentStatusDuration]) 


# In[31]:


# make loan status ordered
loan_status = ['Completed', 'Current', 'Defaulted', 'FinalPaymentInProgress', 'Chargedoff', 'Cancelled']
lstatus = pd.api.types.CategoricalDtype(ordered=True, categories=loan_status)

# taking the borrowers they have loan duration more than their employment duration 
emp = df_loan.loc[(df_loan.EmploymentStatusDuration < df_loan.Term),['EmploymentStatusDuration', 'Term', 'LoanStatus']].copy()
# the rest loan months after employment contract ended = the loan months - the rest months in employment
emp['EmploymentRest'] = emp['Term'] - emp['EmploymentStatusDuration']
emp['Lstatus'] = df_loan['LoanStatus'].astype(lstatus);


# relation between the employment contract duration < loan duration .. Is affect on loan status?
sb.violinplot(data= emp, x='Lstatus', y= 'EmploymentRest')
plt.title('Relation Between Loan Status and Rest Monthly Payment')
plt.xlabel('Loan Status')
plt.ylabel('Rest Monthly Payment');


# > Most of loan status either completed, current or in final payment progress, that's safe. There is rare to convert to cancelled status.

# **Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?** <br>
# The relation between loan amount and monthly income paymemnt is weak! that lead me to allowing any borrower to make any loan amount regardless income, if qualify other features. I thought that was a stronge relation between them, if the loan amount was a big that's mean the monthly payment also more. 
# 
# **Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?** <br>
# There are amount number of borrowers (36536) they have loan duration is more than their employment duration, they may causing kind of risk. Surely, there is should be other features have guarntees to relieve from this risk.

# <a id='multi'></a>
# ## Multivariate Exploration

# The section contains creating effective multivariate exploration for dataset.

# In[32]:


# take the data with income range
income_range = df_loan.loc[df_loan['IncomeRange'].isin(['$1-24,999', '$25,000-49,999', '$50,000-74,999','$75,000-99,999','$100,000+'])].copy()

# relation between income range and the payment months of loan
g = sb.FacetGrid(data = income_range, col = 'IncomeRange', row = 'Term', height = 2.5,
                margin_titles = True)
g.map(plt.scatter, 'IncomeRange', 'Term');


# In[33]:


# Are the prospers loans make borrower more commitment to pay on time without late?
# let's show if there a relation..
df_prosloan.groupby('TotalProsperLoans')[['OnTimeProsperPayments','ProsperPaymentsLessThanOneMonthLate','ProsperPaymentsOneMonthPlusLate']].sum()


# In[34]:


# re-arrange the data
pros_loan = {'#ofLoans': [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8],
                              'Total': [219842, 156859, 75895,  26747,6731, 1671, 422, 37, 6771, 4049, 1813, 624, 153, 36, 25, 1, 542, 318, 147, 40, 4, 6, 4, 2],
                             'PaymentStatus': ['on time', 'on time', 'on time', 'on time', 'on time', 'on time', 'on time', 'on time',
                                       'less month late', 'less month late','less month late','less month late','less month late','less month late','less month late','less month late',

total_pros_loan = pd.DataFrame(pros_loan)
total_pros_loan.head()


# In[35]:


# display the relation between number of prosper loans vs. (payment on time, late < month and late > month).. 
sb.catplot(data=total_pros_loan, x='#ofLoans', y='Total', hue='PaymentStatus', height=10);
plt.title('Relation Between Total Prosper Loans and Payment Status')
plt.xlabel('Total Prosper Loans')
plt.ylabel('Total Status Frequencies');


# > The plot representing while the prosper loans was a lot that will lead to late occurring in payment.

# **Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?** <br>
# The surprise is for each borrowe other loan, the payment status is tend to late within a month and plus a month ,respectivly. I thought the commitment level was will greater not lower!
# May the graet numbers of loans is affect on borrower's income and cuase some financial hardship.

# <a id='con'></a>
# ## Conclusion

# The conclusion of the investigation clarifies that the most exist loans status are current, and completed. Regarding loans categories, loans are for debt consolidation, auto, home improvement, respectively. For borrowers state, CA is got the most loans proportion by 13% followed by TX, FL and NY equally by 6%. For the borrower's occupation, professional has got the most numbers of loans followed by computer programmer and executive. <br>
# Also, the conclusion that there is 50.5% of borrowers they owner home while there is 49.5% of them they didn't own. Additionally, the range of most loans amount is between 5000 and 15000. <br>
# Also, there is a positive and weak relationship between the loan amount and the borrower income.  Finally, if the prosper loans was a lot, that will lead to late occurring in payment, either in less than a month or plus a month.
